# Hi, I'm Joe Beaumont
### Full-stack developer | Analytical Scientist

## About Me
In early 2025, I completed the Northcoders JavaScript Bootcamp, gaining experience in modern web technologies and full-stack project development.

Before moving into tech, I spent over seven years as an analytical scientist in the medical device industry, a career where attention to detail, collaboration and continuous improvement were vital skills

My fascination with technology started early, I spent a lot of time creating RPGs and platformer games using GameMaker and creating mods for my favourite titles.  This interest has grown into a desire to forge a career building scalable, accessible and impactful software.
